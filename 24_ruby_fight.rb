# The Company has two directors who are passionately disagreeing, they want to
# fight it out. Being the fantastic human you are, you propose creating a virtual
 # fight to minimise physical harm.
# You need to create a simple fighting game, where two opponents will fight until
# one of them loses.

# Hints: start by creating a Player class (the instance variables could be name,
# health and power).
# You’ll need a few methods, consider one that keeps track of whether a player is
# alive, another one that calculates the impact of hits (decreases the opponents
# heath by the the amount of the other players power). And a third that outputs
# the players information

# You’ll then need to make a fight method that uses a loop to make the players
# hit one another until  the is alive method returns false for one of them. When
# the loop is finished (which would mean one of the players has lost), show the
# players output.

# Then create two Player objects (create a random value for each player’s health
# and power, make is so that the maximum health value for a player is 200, and
# the maximum power value is 25) and call the fight method.

class Player

  @name
  @power
  @health

  def Alive?
    if player1 or player2 not alive
  end

  def damage
    player1 health -= player2 power
  end

  def stats
  end

  def fight
  end

  loop do
    start fight
    finnish is allive true
    display stats
  end

end

create two players each with random health and power
